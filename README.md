# Pachama Project

## Getting Started
### Installations:
#### REQUIRED
 * Docker [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Running locally
* Once Node, Yarn and Docker are installed Run the following:
    * Command in root directory: `docker compose up`

* Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser

* Shutdown: `docker compose down`

## Notes
### Why Next.js
* SEO
* Speed
* API integration
* Prebuilt routes

### Docker-compose?

Most difficult part of this project was docker compose and its networking between the DB and the app.
Usually I would spin up a test DB in a cloudprovider and work off of that locally.

### Next.js API?

Tradeoff between a POC/MVP and a full fledged scalable app. Serverless would be my preference for the service.

### shell script for seeding

This could have been done within the Dockerfile while the Dynamo Image was building but it seemed faster just to write a quick node script to do this.

### Environment Variables

Working with Docker Compose causes some networking hurdles. For instance, connecting to the Dynamodb instance is usually done with `http://localhost:8000` but within a docker compse you have to connect via the service name 
`http://dynamodb:8000`.

I Havent set up any environment variables to detect if this is running within docker compose or both containers running seperately on your local machine.

If you did want to run both containers seperately on you local machine you would have to change the Dynamo endpoint to `http://localhost:8000` in order to connect.
