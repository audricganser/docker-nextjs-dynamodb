The project, which aims to promote forest conservation and reduce potential greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), likewise emphasizes the importance of local economic development. Over the project’s 30-year lifetime, it is expected to sequester nearly 15 million tonnes of carbon emissions. To prevent illegal deforestation, the project has pledged extensive surveillance and monitoring. ',
